    PROBLEM 1: Using the Elements panel of Chrome Dev tools, locate the h1 element and modify its text content to say "Hello, World!". If you refresh the page, does the heading change?
    */
    Yes the heading changed 

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Create an h2 element that says "Hello, World" in the HTML above. Using the elements panel again, locate the h1 element and modify its content to say "I'm changing the DOM". If you refresh the page, does the h2 change?
    */
    h2 doesn't change because we are updating the h1 element

     /*
    PROBLEM 3: Create a button element that says "Push me" in the HTML above. Using the Elements panel, locate the button element and add a class of "btn" to it. Style the button by adding custom CSS rules within the Styles panel. Does the button still have the styles after a page refresh? Explain your answer.
    */
    The changes disappeared once I refreshed because we did not add the changes to the html doc.

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Open the Chrome DevTools on any webpage. Using the Elements panel, locate a paragraph element and modify its CSS properties, such as changing the font size, color, or adding a background color. Explain how we are able to make changes on the browser.
    */
    We are able to make the changes because all pages have the document object.
